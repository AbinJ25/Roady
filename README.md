### Project Description
Roady is an innovative project designed to assist learner drivers in honing their driving skills. Developed by the team at SineWave, Roady leverages advanced technologies to provide real-time feedback and personalized training modules. The project aims to make the learning process more engaging and effective, ensuring that new drivers gain confidence and competence behind the wheel. Whether it's mastering parallel parking or understanding road signs, Roady is your go-to companion for a safer and smarter driving experience. üöóüí®

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The average driver does not have a reliable good driver that can help them with their driving. There are an increasing number of accidents on the road and these risk the lives of people on and off the road(I know it sounds useful but who listens to anyone).

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We have made a Machine Learning model that can monitor the driving based on the steering input and tell the driver whether their turns were tight enough.
